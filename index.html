Barbie was introduced to the world at the American Toy Fair in New York City. Barbie's job was teenage fashion doll. The full name of the first doll was Barbie Millicent Roberts, from Willows, Wisconsin.</p>

						<p class="merriweather">In 1958, English pictorial photographer Henry Peach Robinson created the world’s first photomontage by combining five different negatives to make one complete print of a young girl on her deathbed. “Fading Away”—Robinson’s first and most famous composite photo—depicts a young girl dying of consumption and was controversial when it was exhibited, with many believing it was not a suitable subject for photography.</p>

						<p class="col-9 offset-3 text-right">On the night of Aug 1975, a line pf people frantically piled sandbags atop Henan Province’s <strong class="merriweather-bold-italic">Banqiao Dam</strong> while being battered by the worst storm ever recorded in the region. They were in a race with the rapidly rising Ru River to save the dam and the millions of peopl that lay sleeping downsteam.<br/>It was a race they were about to lose.</p>
						<p class="col-9">Just after 1:00am, the sky cleared and stars emerged from behind the storm clouds. There was an eerie calm as someone yelled, “The water level is going down! The flood is retreating!”</p>
						<p class="col-10 offset-1">There was little chance to enjoy that calm. One survivor recalled that a few seconds later it “sounded like the sky was collapsing and the earth was cracking”. The equivalent of 280,000 Olympic-sized swiming pools burst through the crumbling dam, taking with it entire towns and as many as 171,000 lives.</p>
