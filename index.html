						<p class="merriweather">In 1958, English pictorial photographer Henry Peach Robinson created the world’s first photomontage by combining five different negatives to make one complete print of a young girl on her deathbed. “Fading Away”—Robinson’s first and most famous composite photo—depicts a young girl dying of consumption and was controversial when it was exhibited, with many believing it was not a suitable subject for photography.</p>

						<p class="col-9 offset-3 text-right">On the night of Aug 1975, a line pf people frantically piled sandbags atop Henan Province’s <strong class="merriweather-bold-italic">Banqiao Dam</strong> while being battered by the worst storm ever recorded in the region. They were in a race with the rapidly rising Ru River to save the dam and the millions of peopl that lay sleeping downsteam.<br/>It was a race they were about to lose.</p>
						<p class="col-9">Just after 1:00am, the sky cleared and stars emerged from behind the storm clouds. There was an eerie calm as someone yelled, “The water level is going down! The flood is retreating!”</p>
						<p class="col-10 offset-1">There was little chance to enjoy that calm. One survivor recalled that a few seconds later it “sounded like the sky was collapsing and the earth was cracking”. The equivalent of 280,000 Olympic-sized swiming pools burst through the crumbling dam, taking with it entire towns and as many as 171,000 lives.</p>
